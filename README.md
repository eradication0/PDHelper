# PDHelper  
A simple app to edit the memory of Phantom Dust to give max out credits/skills aswell as load/edit/backup any arsenal you want.  
The app will not connect to anything that is not Phantom Dust, so no random edits on any other process can occur.

# False Positives
Since the app writes directly into the Phantom Dust process memory, some anti-viruses detect it as unwanted/malicious

# How it works 
Basically im using a library called [memory.dll](https://github.com/erfg12/memory.dll) it allows to read, search and write memory directly into applications. The rest of all the files/code just comes with VisualStudio and their .net library stuff.
