A simple app to edit the memory of Phantom Dust to give max out spells and credits

1. Just open up the app  
2. attach it to the game  
3. go to the "lab" in the game  
4. click the options you need  
  
it uses a simple library called "memory.dll" to use pointers to find specific parts of the memory to reliably edit the result  
  
thanks to guild "Octo Dazzle" for helping out
