# PDHelper  
A simple app to edit the memory of Phantom Dust to give max out credits/skills aswell as load/edit/backup any arsenal you want.  
The app will not connect to anything that is not Phantom Dust, so no random edits on any other process can occur.

# Arsenal Features
**Save Arsenals** directly into the game  
**Backup Arsenals** as a file to store infinite Arsenals that can be loaded at any time  
**Share Arsenals** via just sending the file, no more recreating Arsenal via screenshot  
**Edit Arsenals** between games to optimize Arsenals on the fly  
**Change Arsenal Case Type** directly, no more need to delete and buy a new case  
**Reorder Arsenals** so you can keep it nice and tidy  
**Rename Arsenal**s directly, allowing more special characters than in-game  
  
# Other Features  
**Max out credits and skills** to make the game a even playing field for everyone  
**Toggle Team Lock-On** even during a match to make support decks more viable  
**Anti Cheat Mechanisms** are in place to prevent creating normally impossible arsenals    
**Bugfixes** have been done over the last 2 weeks to ensure the app runs stable and does not break anything, thanks to the testing team for that  
  
# False Positives
Since the app writes directly into the Phantom Dust process memory, some anti-viruses detect it as unwanted/malicious

# How it works 
Basically im using a library called [memory.dll](https://github.com/erfg12/memory.dll) it allows to read, search and write memory directly into applications. The rest of all the files/code just comes with VisualStudio and their .net library stuff.
