# PDHelper
A simple app to edit the memory of Phantom Dust to give max out spells and credits

the app will not connect to anything that is not Phantom Dust, so no random edits on any other process can occur.

1. Just open up the app  
2. attach it to the game  
3. go to the "lab" in the game  
4. click the options you need  
  
download it from the release tab or here

thanks to guild "Octo Dazzle" for helping out
  
  
it uses a simple library called "memory.dll" to use pointers to find specific parts of the memory to reliably edit the result
